# Security Implementation Guide

This document outlines the comprehensive security measures implemented in the MedMap application to ensure user data isolation and professional-grade security.

## Overview

The MedMap application implements a multi-layered security approach with the following key features:

### Authentication & Authorization
- **JWT Token Management**: Secure token-based authentication with automatic refresh
- **Enhanced Token Validation**: Tokens are validated against database user records
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Different permission levels for different user types
- **Account Locking**: Automatic account locking after failed login attempts

### Password Security
- **Strong Password Requirements**: 
  - Minimum 8 characters
  - Must contain uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters
- **Bcrypt Hashing**: Passwords are hashed using bcrypt with salt rounds of 12
- **Password History**: Prevents reuse of recent passwords

### Account Protection
- **Failed Login Tracking**: Monitors and limits failed login attempts
- **Login Attempt Tracking**: Counts failed login attempts
- **Automatic Account Locking**: Locks account after 5 failed attempts for 2 hours
- **Account Recovery**: Secure password reset functionality

### Data Security
- **User Data Isolation**: Multi-tenant architecture ensures data separation
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive validation on all user inputs
- **SQL Injection Prevention**: Parameterized queries and input sanitization
- **XSS Protection**: Content Security Policy and input sanitization

### API Security
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevents abuse and brute force attacks
- **CORS Configuration**: Proper cross-origin resource sharing setup
- **Request Validation**: All API requests are validated and sanitized
- **Error Handling**: Secure error messages that don't leak sensitive information

## Implementation Details

### User Authentication Flow

1. **Login Process**:
   - User submits credentials
   - System validates email format and password requirements
   - Credentials are checked against hashed passwords in database
   - JWT token is generated and returned
   - Failed attempts are tracked

2. **Token Management**:
   - Tokens have expiration times
   - Automatic token refresh mechanism
   - Token validation on every protected request
   - Secure token storage in HTTP-only cookies

3. **Session Management**:
   - Automatic session timeout
   - Secure logout functionality
   - Session invalidation on security events

### Data Isolation

The application implements a multi-tenant architecture where:

- Each user's data is isolated by user ID
- Database queries include user-specific filters
- No cross-user data access is possible
- Audit trails track all data access

### Security Headers

The application includes the following security headers:

```
X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
X-Frame-Options: DENY
X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains
Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'
```

### Rate Limiting

API endpoints are protected with rate limiting:

- **Authentication endpoints**: 5 requests per 15 minutes
- **General API endpoints**: 100 requests per 15 minutes
- **File upload endpoints**: 10 requests per 15 minutes

### Input Validation

All user inputs are validated using:

- **Email validation**: RFC 5322 compliant email format
- **Password validation**: Minimum strength requirements
- **Data sanitization**: Removal of potentially malicious content
- **Type checking**: Ensuring correct data types

### Error Handling

The application implements secure error handling:

- **Generic error messages**: Don't reveal system internals
- **Logging**: All errors are logged for monitoring
- **User-friendly messages**: Clear but non-revealing error messages
- **Graceful degradation**: System continues to function even with errors
